# Capture model playground
Here you can try creating a capture model from scratch using a shorthand syntax.

Each new line is a single field, you can add modifiers to the field by using the following syntax:
```
{@modified-name/modifier-value}
```

The available modifiers are:

- `{@many}` - Allows multiple instances of the field
- `{@default/some value}` - Sets the default value of the field
- `{@type/some-field-type}` - Sets the type of the field
- `{@lang/en}` - Sets the language of the field
- `{@langs/en,fr,es}` - Sets the languages of the field (comma separated)
- `{@defaultLang/en}` - Sets the default language of the field
- `{@description/some description}` - Sets the description of the field
- `{@pluralLabel/things}` - Sets the plural label of the field when multiple instances are allowed

Press the "Preview" button to see the resulting capture model.
