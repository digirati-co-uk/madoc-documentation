# Project members

<Callout emoji="ðŸš€" type="info">New in <strong>Madoc v2.2</strong></Callout>


Starting from Madoc v2.2, users who submit a contribution to a project which is then accepted, or perform a review in a
project will be automatically added as a "project member". At the moment this relation is not used in many places,
but we hope it can form the basis of new features in the near future.

Currently, when a user is a project member, they will be listed on the project page under the "contributors" tab:
![](</assets/contributors-panel.png>)

<Callout type="default">
  This is a page block, so you can reorder and move it around on the project page if you want to make this more
  prominent or remove it from a project.
</Callout>

Additionally, only project members will be able to leave feedback on a project from the feedback tab.

### Future

In the future you will be able to:

- Manually manage project members (add and remove)
- Make a project only visible to project members
- Show projects that you are a member of on your User Homepage and user profile

If you have any suggestions or ideas on how this feature could evolve,
please  [open a discussion](https://github.com/digirati-co-uk/madoc-platform/discussions) on the Madoc Github.


### Migrating from Madoc 2.x

If you are upgrading to Madoc v2.2 from a previous version, you can add all users who have previously submitted to a
project with a migration button. You will need to do this for each site individually.  From the menu go to
"Global -> System status".

Here you will see a new button "Migrate project members". Click this and wait a moment. Once complete you should see
a success message confirming the migration:

Now users who previously contributed will be project members.
