# IIIF Viewer changes

### Resize Button
New in Madoc v2.2 the resize button on the left hand side of the viewer can be found in the model view of a canvas.
When clicked it will resize the viewer to one of three modes, wide, narrow and default cycling through in that order.

**Wide**: will give more space to the right hand model \
**Narrow**: will give more space to the viewer \

The pane can be resized allowing the user to view two canvases side by side. \
Use the left hand arrow to go back or the right hand toggle to expand the breadcrumbs of the chosen canvas to easily navigate. You can also use the left and right arrows on the canvas panel to go step though the manifest
