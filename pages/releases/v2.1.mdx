# Madoc v2.1

This is a larger release and include changes to bring Madoc inline with Canvas Panel and Manifest Editor, and
supports a wider range of IIIF resources as a result.

* **🚀 Faster** - Smaller bundles and quicker page loads
* **✨ New Capture Model API** - Rewritten and simplified this will ensure any further development all happens in the same
repository. There is a migration step, but it will also migrate on the fly as you go, so no changes required. Once we
have verified everyone has migrated, we will remove the old service.
* **📦 New page blocks** - Lots of new page blocks have been added and extra customisation to existing ones
* **🎨 New theme options** - There are lots of new ways to customise Madoc headers/footers with page blocks or remote URLs
* **⚡️ Canvas Panel** - Madoc now uses Canvas Panel to render resources and will continue updating to view new types of
IIIF resources while adding annotation support along the way
