## Technical changes
There are some technical changes that have been made in this release that may affect you if you are developing plugins
or extensions for Madoc.


### Madoc extensions

For this release we have [documented](developers/extensions/overview) the available extension points in Madoc. Some extension points are only accessible
through making changes to codebase, and others have been added to the plugin system.

We have also added some new extension points:

- [Autocomplete sources](/developers/extensions/autocomplete-sources)
- [Export configurations in plugins](/developers/extensions/export-formats)
- [Automation / bots](/developers/extensions/task-automation)
- [Web hooks](/developers/extensions/webhooks)
- [New crowdsourcing task metadata](/developers/extensions/task-metadata-resolvers)


### Tailwind

Currently, Madoc primarily uses [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling. This has been a great
way to get started, but we have found that it is not as easy to maintain as we would like and has not scaled well. We
have therefore decided to migrate to [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling new components. This also allows
us to grab some of the great components that exist in the community and use them in Madoc, linking them up to the page
block system.

There are around 400 Styled Components used in Madoc currently, so it is unlikely that we will be able to migrate all of
these in one go. We will therefore be migrating components as we go, and will be using Tailwind for all new components.
