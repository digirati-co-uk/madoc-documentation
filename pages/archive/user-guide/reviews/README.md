# Reviews

When a user submits their contribution to your project it will be put into a review workflow alongside other users who has also submitted their work. This process ensures quality from submissions but also allows multiple people to work on the same thing at the same time.

At its core, a review is a [**task**](../../incomplete-user-guide/tasks/) that is assigned to a reviewer that points to one or more contribution tasks from users.

Each submission from users can be actioned, with the goal of either approving or rejecting the submission.
