    * **Manifest crowdsourcing task** - A task that represents a whole manifest
    * **Manifest crowdsourcing review** - A review of a crowdsourcing manifest task (above).
    * **Canvas** - All of the canvases in the manifest
      * **Canvas crowdsourcing task** - All of the crowdsourcing contributions to this canvas
      * **Canvas crowdsourcing review** - All of the reviews for this manifest
