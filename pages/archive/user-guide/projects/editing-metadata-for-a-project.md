# Editing metadata for a project

The details tab in the project landing page lets you change the label and description of your project. These labels will be used along side any content that is part of the project on the main site. This can be used to direct users to contribute or see the outputs of your project.

Once you have entered the details for your project, you can click "save changes" to confirm. Similar to IIIF content, you can add multi-lingual values for each of these.
