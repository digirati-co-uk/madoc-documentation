# Pausing and retiring a project

On a project overview page you can choose to pause a project. If the project is "resumed" then it will be visible to users on the site. The other options are only labels for internal use to indicate the status of a project.

You can still navigate to your project as an administrator to see how the project looks, customise content. You will see a warning message indicating that only you can see this project.
