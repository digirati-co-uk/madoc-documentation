# Editing the projects model

If you click on the "Model" tab in the project overview you will see a page that with the following tabs:

* **Home**
* **Document** - description of data in your model, presented as form fields
* **Structure** - nested groups of fields from your document
* **Preview** - where you can test your model

There are 2 main sections of a model. The first is the document. Each image you crowdsource will have a copy of this document. All of the contributions from users on the same image will be building up this single document. A document can have either fields for values inputted, such as transcriptions fields, or Entities. Entities are a way of nesting related fields.

A contributor may be able to add multiple instances of each of these fields and entities. Your document may contain a lot of different fields that could be crowdsourced. To manage this and avoid a single large form being presented to the user the document is split up using a Structure. A structure is a subset of the fields from the document. This drives a navigation so the user can decide what they want to contribute and then only see the fields for that thing.

Check the [Capture models](../capture-models/) section for an in-depth look at creating models.
