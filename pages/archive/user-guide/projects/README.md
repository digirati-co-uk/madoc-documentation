# Projects

Projects are a core part of Madoc, they represent a set of tasks that need to be completed for each item in a set of content. Each site in Madoc can have multiple projects and each project can be run on a subset of the Collections and Manifests that have been imported.

A project is made up of the following components:

* [**Content**](adding-content-to-a-project.md) - The IIIF content that will be worked on in the project
* [**Configuration**](configuring-a-project.md) - Specific configuration for this project to customise aspects of the project.
* [**Capture model** ](../capture-models/)- A template that describes what information you want to crowdsource for each of the canvases in the project.&#x20;
* [**Tasks**](../../incomplete-user-guide/tasks/) - A tree of tasks that represent all of the progress of the project.

Projects are primarily made up of tasks. A task is a small unit of work that can be assigned to a single user and target a piece of content. Whenever a user contributes to a project it will be recorded as a task. This task will be visible to that user so they can go back to their work and see its status as it progresses. When a contribution needs to be reviewed - this also becomes another task and is assigned to a reviewer on the site.

This chapter will take you through creating and setting up a project.
