# Adding OCR correction to capture model

Once you have added Manifests with OCR to Madoc you can add them to a project with a compatible capture model.

From the "Projects" page, you can create a new "OCR Correction" project from the list of templates.

You'll be guided through some details and some settings for your project.

Once complete you can add Manifests that have OCR from the "Content" tab.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Madoc will not stop you from adding Manifests that do **not** have OCR attached, make sure you are only adding Manifests with confirmed and imported OCR to this project.
{% endhint %}

When you run your project, you'll be able to see the hOCR or Alto visualised. Contributors to your project will be able to read and correct any lines of text. These will be submitted where they can be reviewed.
