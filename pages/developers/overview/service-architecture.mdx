# Service Architecture

Madoc is made up of a number of services, each of which is responsible for a specific part of the application. The services are:

- Madoc API
- Tasks API
- Config API
- Search + Enrichment API
- Storage API

Additionally, there is a single persistent database (PostgreSQL) and a cache (Redis) that is available to all services.

There are 5 core pieces of Madoc that are used to build each service. These are:
- [PostgreSQL](#postgresql)
- [Site sandboxing](#site-sandboxing)
- [JWT Authentication](#jwt-authentication)
- [APIs](#apis)
- [Tasks + Queue](#tasks--queue)

With these 5 core pieces, Madoc can be extended to support new features and new services. They are the building blocks
of the application.

## PostgreSQL
Madoc uses PostgreSQL as the only database. This is used to store all the data that is used by the application. Each
service has its own schema in the database. This allows for each service to have its own data model and for the data
to be stored in a way that is optimised for the service. This gives ownership to the services and their migrations.

Extensions that are used by the database are:
- `uuid-ossp` - This is used to generate UUIDs for the database [Docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/uuid-ossp.html)
- `ltree` - This is used to store hierarchical data and search in the database [Docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ltree.html)


## Site sandboxing
When an installation of Madoc comprises a number of sites. Each site is sandboxed from the others. This means that each site
can have its own configuration, users, and content. The only thing that is shared between sites is the user database,
which is shared across all sites. IIIF manifests are cached to speed up importing on other sites.

Users can have different roles on different sites. For example, a user could be an administrator on one site, and a
contributor on another. This is enforced with JWT tokens given to the user on login for each site.

## JWT Authentication
Madoc uses JWT tokens for authentication. These tokens are signed with a secret key, and are valid for a configurable
amount of time. The tokens are used to authenticate requests to the API and are stored in encrypted cookies in the
browser. The tokens are also used to authenticate requests between services. Tokens that are used by services can
make requests on behalf of users, and can be configured to have different permissions than the user that they are
acting on behalf of.

The information stored in the tokens is as follows:

**User or Service ID** (`"sub"`) - A unique identifier for the user or service, shared across multiple sites. This will
be used to fingerprint actions and could be used to drive lightweight access controls on a per-service, per-scope basis.

**User or Service display name** (`"name"`) - Something that the user can be referred to when presenting the user and
other users with references to other users. May be persisted by services. This is a
[public claim](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.2) defined in
[OpenID Connect Core 5.1](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims)

**Site** (`"iss"`) - Unique identifier for the site that issues the token. This may be an abstract site
(e.g. a client specific dashboard) or a physically different website. For service tokens, the gateway itself will be
the issuer.

**Site name** (`"iss_name"`) - In addition to a unique identifier, a human readable site name will be added to the
token. This allows for UI to be driven from the token, for very light feedback to a user.
This is a [private claim](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.3)

**User scope** (`"scope"`) - The scope defines the scopes of a site that the user has access to. This will be used
along side the overall role of the user to determine what the user can read, update and remove. This is
a [public claim](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.2) defined
in [rfc8693 4.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8693#section-4.2).

A service can request a service token in the form of a JSON object that contains a `scope` and a `service` field.

When making a request to the API Gateway a service can do an action on behalf of another user by sending the following
headers:

- `x-madoc-user-id: urn:madoc:user:123`
- `x-madoc-site-id: urn:madoc:site:456`

These _can_ be read by a service if it wishes to support this feature.

#### Example user token
```json
{
    "iss": "urn:madoc:site:123",
    "sub": "urn:madoc:user:456",
    "exp": 123233434234,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "iss_name": "Site 123",
    "scope": "scope-1 scope-2 scope-3"
}
```

#### Example Service token request
```json
{
  "scope": ["models.admin", "site.admin", "tasks.admin"],
  "service": {
    "id": "montague-nlp",
    "name": "Montague (Service)"
  }
}
```

#### Example resulting service token
```json
{
    "iss": "api-gateway",
    "sub": "montague-nlp",
    "exp": 9999999999999,
    "name": "Montague (Service)",
    "iss_name": "API Gateway",
    "scope": "models.admin site.admin tasks.admin"
}
```

#### Example parsed user JWT in application (js)
```js
const jwt = {
    token: '==....',
    user: {
      id: 'urn:madoc:user:456',
      service: false,
      serviceId: undefined,
      name: 'John Doe',
    },
    site: {
      gateway: false,
      id: 'urn:madoc:site:123',
      name: 'Site 123',
    },
    scope: ['scope-1', 'scope-2', 'scope-3'],
    context: ['urn:madoc:site:123'],
}
```

#### Example parsed site JWT in application (js)
```js
const jwt = {
    token: '==....',
    user: {
      id: 'montague-nlp',
      service: true,
      serviceId: 'montague-nlp',
      name: 'Montague (Service)',
    },
    site: {
      gateway: true,
      id: 'api-gateway',
      name: 'API Gateway',
    },
    scope: ['models.admin', 'site.admin', 'tasks.admin'],
    context: ['api-gateway'],
}
```

#### Example parsed site JWT in application with custom headers (js)
Same as above, but with the following headers to act as user:
- `x-madoc-user-id: urn:madoc:user:123`
- `x-madoc-site-id: urn:madoc:site:456`

```js
const jwt = {
    token: '==....',
    user: {
      id: 'urn:madoc:user:123', // <-- x-madoc-user-id
      service: true,
      serviceId: 'montague-nlp',
      name: 'Montague (Service)',
    },
    site: {
      gateway: true,
      id: 'urn:madoc:site:456', // <-- x-madoc-site-id
      name: '', // No site name in this scenario.
    },
    scope: ['models.admin', 'site.admin', 'tasks.admin'],
    context: ['urn:madoc:site:456'], // <-- x-madoc-site-id
}
```

## APIs

Every service has an API that is exposed to the API Gateway. The API Gateway is responsible for routing requests to
the correct service. The API Gateway is also responsible for authenticating requests and ensuring that the user has
the correct permissions to perform the action. Services don't need to validate the JWT token and can trust the information
that is passed to them. This also makes testing easier as services don't need to mock out the authentication layer.

Most APIs are RESTful, but some are not. Over time these APIs will be documented here for reference.

For public APIs that can be accessed by anyone, the API Gateway will not require a JWT token. These public endpoints
are usually wrappers around other APIs that are not public and appear under the `/s/{site}/madoc/api` path.

## Tasks + Queue

For information that changes over time Madoc uses a task queue. This is a simple queue that is backed by Redis with
task information stored in Postgres by the Tasks API. The queue can represent either a single task performed and assigned
to a user, or a batch of tasks that are performed by a service. The queue is used to perform tasks such as importing
IIIF manifests, indexing search, and generating OCR. User contributions and reviews are also stored as tasks.

Madoc uses [BullMQ](https://docs.bullmq.io/) for the task queue. This is a simple Redis backed queue that allows for
tasks to be distributed to workers. The queue is backed by Redis and the Tasks API is responsible for storing task
information in the database. The queue distributes events that contain the Task ID that can be used to retrieve the
task information from the Tasks API.

In the main Madoc application there is the ability to listen for events that are emitted by the queue. For example,
you can listen for when a task is completed and then perform an action, or the assignee changes. This allows for a mix
of synchronous and asynchronous actions to be performed by services or by user interaction.

Large tasks are broken down into sub-tasks that are then distributed to workers. This allows for large tasks to be
performed in parallel. For example, when importing a large IIIF manifest, the manifest is broken down into individual
canvases and then each canvas is imported in parallel. This allows for large manifests to be imported in a reasonable
amount of time. In this example, each canvas is a sub-task of the manifest import task. There is an event on the manifest
task that is emitted when all the canvases have been imported.

The list of events available are:
- `created`
- `modified`
- `assigned`
- `assigned_to`
- `status`
- `subtask_created`
- `subtask_type_created`
- `subtask_status`
- `subtask_type_status`
- `deleted`

The subtask events can be further refined:
- `subtask_status.3` - when all subtasks are complete
- `subtask_type_status.export-resource-task.3` - when all subtasks of a specific type are complete

#### Example workflow: Manifest import.

- User posts a manifest and an import task is created
  - The task has a type of `madoc-manifest-import`
  - The task has a status of `pending`
  - The task is configured to listen for the following events:
      - `created`
      - `subtask_type_status.madoc-canvas-import.3` (all canvases imported)
- The task is picked up by a worker and the manifest is imported
  - The task has a status of `progress`
  - Each canvas is imported as a subtask
  - Each subtask has a type of `madoc-canvas-import`
  - Each subtask has a status of `pending`
- The worker imports each canvas
- The worker updates the status of each subtask to `complete`
- The event `subtask_type_status.madoc-canvas-import.3` is emitted
  - Madoc will associate each imported canvas with the manifest
  - Madoc will update the status of the manifest import task to `complete`
- The import is complete

The workflow allows for the canvases to be imported in parallel, and for the manifest structure to be updated when all canvases
have been imported and the canvas identifiers are known.
