- Replacing frontend with Typescript
- Removal of Omeka + PHP


## Omeka-S + Microservices
Madoc began development in early 2017 in partnership with the National Library of Wales (NLW) and the Indigenous Digital
Archives (IDA). The goal was to use IIIF and Linked Data to create a platform for the crowdsourcing of metadata, structural
data, transcriptions and points of interest on images from digital collections.

There was a split between the "Frontend" side and backend services. The frontend was built using Omeka-S, a PHP based
content management system. The backend was built using a collection of many different microservices written in Java and
Python and heavily utilising Amazon AWS services. The frontend and backend communicated using many different REST APIs.

The frontend of Omeka was built using Omeka-S theme system, but utilised a custom build-step to compile the frontend
assets. At the time this was done using Grunt, babel, Sass and a few other tools.

We identified a few issues with this approach:
- The frontend was difficult to develop and test locally
- Deployment was difficult and required a lot of manual steps
- Omeka-S was not designed for the volume of data we were working with

## Consolidation

During the autumn of 2019 we took a step back and look at the platform and where we wanted to go with it. We identified
a few key areas that we wanted to improve:

- Independent frontend development
- Easier deployments
- Less moving parts

And put together a plan to address these issues:

* Single database for all services
* Single API endpoint for all services
* Single method of authorisation for all services
* Site sandboxing from the start
* Single method of deployment for all services (Docker)
* Single method of configuration for all services (config api + environment variables)
* No requirement of a commercial integration (e.g. AWS or Azure)

These changes would allow us to build a platform that was easier to develop, easier to deploy and easier to maintain.
During the first half of 2020 we began to implement these changes and move the platform forward. During this time we
were working with [Ghent Centre for Digital Humanities](https://www.ghentcdh.ugent.be/) and [Staatsbibliothek Berlin](https://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/en/).

## Building a foundation

We decided to rewrite the backend services in Python and to use Django as the framework. We started building some of
the foundational services that we would need to build the platform. These included:

- Configuration API
- Tasks API
- Search API
- Model API (now merged into Madoc)

The Configuration and Search APIs were built in Python using Django. The Tasks API and Model API was built in Typescript
using Node.js with the Koa framework.

## Madoc

After the initial development, we started working on a set of APIs and new Admin Frontend that would replace the
Omeka-S Admin UI. This was built using Typescript and React. We began with replacing the IIIF storage APIs, utilising
the new Tasks API to handle much larger volumes of data.

Once we replaced the Admin side, we moved to replacing the public side of Omeka-S and eventually removed the PHP
dependency entirely. However, we still used the Omeka-S database which was stored in MySQL. Towards the end of development
we migrated the final tables over to Postgres and removed the MySQL dependency.
