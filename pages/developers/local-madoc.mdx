# Running Madoc locally

Madoc is made up of multiple services. To make getting started easy, we have created a `docker-compose` file that will start all the services you need to run Madoc locally.

Before getting started, you should make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine.

## Downloading the example

To get started, you can download the example from the [Madoc Config](https://github.com/digirati-co-uk/madoc-config) repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/digirati-co-uk/madoc-config.git
```

alternatively, if you don't have git installed, you can download the repository as a zip file from the GiHub page.

## Generating an installation code

When you start Madoc for the first time you will be prompted for an installation code. This code is used to secure your installation and should be kept secret.


In the folder that you downloaded, you will find a `.env` file. You should add the installation code to this file.

```bash
MADOC_INSTALLATION_CODE='$2b$14$ueEIZDJzwJykrhb2cHP2au7cWgajysfx.QlBS3TGs/qtoENloYGRu'
```

This can be used for testing, and the code you should enter in the box is simply `password`.

If you want to generated a new code, you will need to ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.

From the folder, if you run the following command:

```bash
node ./tools/install-code.js
```

and then follow the instructions, you will be able to generate a new installation code. You can put this into your `.env` file.

## Running Madoc

Once you have set the installation code, you can start Madoc by running the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start all the services you need to run Madoc. You can access the site by visiting [http://localhost:8878/](http://localhost:8878/).

Here you will be prompted to enter the installation code you set earlier and then choose a username and password for the admin user and details for the default "site" in Madoc. If you used the code provided above, the installation code is `password`.

## Stopping Madoc

To stop Madoc, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

This will stop all the services that are running. The database will persist, including an files. These volumes are handled by Docker and will be removed if you run `docker-compose down`.

You can see the example [here](https://github.com/digirati-co-uk/madoc-config/blob/main/ec2/docker-compose.yaml) of customising the `docker-compose` with volumes and environment variables, suitable for running on a server on port 80.

## Seeing logs

To see the logs for the services, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

There are a lot of logs, so you can filter by service name, for example the main Madoc web service (`madoc-ts`)

```bash
docker-compose logs -f madoc-ts
```

This can be useful for debugging any issues you might have.

## Next steps

Once you have Madoc running, you can start to
[add content](/admin-guide/managing-iiif/importing) to your site and follow the admin guide to get started.
