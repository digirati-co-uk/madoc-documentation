# Task automation

The Tasks API and the queue allow for tasks that require user input to be defined and tracked as users make progress on
them. The API also allows for tasks to be automated, so that they can be completed without user input. It also offers
a hook into the task lifecycle, so that you can be notified when a task is completed.

One way to do this is with task automation. This uses a "Bot" to progress or modify tasks. The bot is a class that
defines a set of compatible tasks and events it should be notified of, and then implements the logic to progress the
tasks. It also has a set of manual actions that can be displayed and triggered by a user. This allows for a bot to
be used to automate tasks, but also to allow a task to run batches of tasks.

## Creating a Bot

Bots must extend the `BaseAutomation` class and can implement the `ManualActions` and/or `TaskAutomation` interfaces.

A bot is like a template. In the Admin interface you will be able to create a bot, assign it a type from a list of
available bots, and then configure it. The bot will then be able to be used to automate tasks. Bots are the same
as normal users, so you must also ensure they have the correct site permissions and roles for the task they are doing.

```ts
export class MyBot extends BaseAutomation implements ManualActions, TaskAutomation {

  // Each bot requires a type, this will be stored in the database and used to identify the bot.
  static type = 'my-bot';

  getTaskEvents() {
    return {
      'crowdsourcing-task': ['assigned'],
    }
  }

  async handleTaskEvent(task: CrowdsourcingTask, event: string): Promise<void> {
    if (task.type === 'crowdsourcing-task' && event === 'assigned') {
      // Bots have access to an API instance that is authenticated as the bot.
      this.api.updateTask(task.id, { status: 3 });
    }
  }

  async handleManualAction(action: string, data?: any) {
    if (action === 'do-stuff') {
      // Do some stuff.
    }
  }

  static getManualActions(): ManualAction[] {
    return [
      {
        label: 'Do some stuff',
        action: 'do-stuff',
      },
    ];
  }
}
```

Once the bot is created it can be added to the [bot-definitions.ts](https://github.com/digirati-co-uk/madoc-platform/blob/main/services/madoc-ts/src/automation/bot-definitions.ts)

Here you add the metadata for the bot such as a label, description and thumbnail that will be displayed on the admin.
You can also define custom configuration that will be passed to the bot, and also the site-role that this bot will require.

You will also need to add the bot to the "bots" list in [automation/index.ts](https://github.com/digirati-co-uk/madoc-platform/blob/main/services/madoc-ts/src/automation/index.ts)
so that it will be picked up and used when executing tasks.

## Future expansion

At the moment bots will only work on tasks that have been assigned to them. The workflow is to assign a task to a bot,
and then the bot will be notified of the task and can then progress it. Other parts of Madoc could be expanded in the
future to use this mechanism. For example, a bot could be used to expire a task after a certain amount of time - this
would involve assigning the expired task to the bot and then the bot could do various things with it. Different bots
could do different things with the expired task, for example, one bot could just mark it as expired, another could
assign it to a different user, and another could delete it.

Bots could also be used to test projects in a system. For example a test bot could be given a project and make random
contributions to the project and fill out various parts of the capture model. This would allow for testing of the
review system, the exports at the end of the project and how the project is displayed in the public interface.
