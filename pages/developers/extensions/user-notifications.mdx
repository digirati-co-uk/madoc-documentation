# User notification API

In Madoc, anywhere in the backend where you have access to the `api` object that has `site.admin` permissions you can
send a notification to a user. The notification API can be access via `api.notifications`. It contains the following
methods:

- `getAllNotifications(page = 0)` - returns paginated notifications for the current user.
- `getNotificationCount()` - returns the number of notifications for the current user.
- `readAllNotifications()` - marks all notifications as read for the current user.
- `readNotification(id)` - marks a single notification as read for the current user.
- `clearAllNotifications()` - clears all notifications for the current user.

Additionally, you can create a notification for a user using the `createNotification` method.

```ts
await api.notifications.createNotification({
  id: generateId(),
  title: 'Title of notification',
  summary: 'Summary of notification',
  action: {
    id: 'task:admin',
    link: `urn:madoc:task:${taskId}`,
  },
  user: 123,
});
```

You will have to provide the UUID for the notification, a title, a summary, an action, and the user ID. You can
expand the action types in the [NotificationCenter](https://github.com/digirati-co-uk/madoc-platform/blob/96966fd64a037d8a4e5d877bee794cf2cce67f50/services/madoc-ts/src/frontend/shared/components/NotificationCenter.tsx#L179) component.

Action types supported:

- `task:admin` - link to a task in the admin interface.
- `task` - link to a task in the site interface.
- `manifest` - link to a manifest in the site interface.
- `user` - link to a users profile in the admin interface. (used for new registration notifications)
