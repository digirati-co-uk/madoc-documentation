# Overview

Madoc is a large system with lots of core pieces that will change slowly over time. It has a lot of complexity in order
to support the various needs of the platform. However, there are a number of **extension points** that are great
opportunities to extend the platform without having to worry about these core pieces, and thus complexity and potential
cost.

The extension points offer clearly defined ways to extend the platform, and are designed to be as simple as possible to
implement. This section will explain the various extension points and how to use them. This will be a reference guide
for developers but also for those who want to understand how the platform works and potentially contribute to the
future of the platform.
