# Page blocks

In Madoc almost all UI elements are built using a block system. This allows for a high degree of flexibility in the UI.
On any page you can hit "edit" and customise which blocks appear. Each page is split into horizontal sections called
**slots**. Each slot can contain multiple blocks.

Currently, there is only one layout for the blocks in a slot, but there is a mechanism to allow for different layouts. By
default, they will be displayed in rows.

## Custom blocks

Page blocks are one of the most extensible features of Madoc. You can create your own blocks and add them to the
interface through plugins or in the codebase itself.

An example of a custom block can be seen here:

```jsx
export function HelloWorld(props) {
  return <div>Hello {props.name || 'world'}!</div>;
}

blockEditorFor(HelloWorld, {
  type: 'hello-world',
  label: 'Hello world',
  defaultProps: {
    name: 'World', // This will pre-populate the form
  },
  editor: {
    name: { label: 'Enter a name', type: 'text-field'},
  },
});
```

This block will then be available when you edit a slot on the page. You can specify which "contexts" this block
requires if you are reading the URL and loading data based on it (e.g. the project ID).

You can read more about custom blocks [here](/developers/page-blocks/custom-blocks)


## Slot rules

<Callout emoji="⭐️" type="info">
  **We are working on a new UI for viewing and editing slot rules.**

  Currently you can make a slot that appears on "all pages of a type" or on a very specific page. In the future
  you will be able to change the rules for a slot, and have more options for how the slot is displayed.
</Callout>

When a user overrides the default slot that is defined in the code it is saved into the database with a "filter". This
filter determines which other pages should use this slot. The available filters are:

* **Project**
* **Collection**
* **Manifest**
* **Canvas**

and two more filters will be added in the future:

* **Topic types**
* **Topics**

When you visit a page in Madoc you will be within a context. This context is determined by the URL. For example, if you
visit `/s/projects/abc-123` then you will be in the context of the project with the ID `abc-123`. If you visit
`/s/projects/abc-123/manifests/789` then you will be in the context of the manifest with the ID `789` and so on.

For each of these potential contexts you may be within on a page you can, in theory, set the following rules for _each_
context on the slot:

- **Show on all** - This will display the slot on all pages that have some value for the context.
- **Show on none** - This will display the slot only when there is no value for the context.
- **Show on specific** - This will display the slot only when the context matches the value.

There are additional fine-tuning with an *allow* and *deny* list for each of the filters.

If you are deep within a project page, viewing a canvas within a manifest which is itself within a collection, the URL
might too something like:

<code className="my-3 p-2 bg-slate-100 block rounded">
/s/projects/**abc-123**/collections/**456**/manifests/**789**/canvases/**1011**
</code>

Here the "context" is:
- **Project**: `abc-123`
- **Collection**: `456`
- **Manifest**: `789`
- **Canvas**: `1011`

And you would be able to set the rules for each of these contexts. For example, you may want to show a specific
block at the top of ALL canvases in this collection. For that you could specify rules as follows:

- **Project**: Show on all
- **Collection**: Show on specific `456`
- **Manifest**: Show on all
- **Canvas**: Show on all

This would mean that the block would show on all canvases in the collection `456`.

You could override this rule for a specific manifest by setting the rules as follows:

- **Project**: Show on all
- **Collection**: Show on specific `456`
- **Manifest**: Show on specific `789`
- **Canvas**: Show on all

Although both rules match, this one will have a higher priority because it is more specific.
