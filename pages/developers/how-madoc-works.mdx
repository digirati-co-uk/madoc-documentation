# How Madoc Works

When the second version of Madoc was planned in 2019 we made an effort to simplify the architecture across the various
languages and services. The decisions we made then are still in place today.

* Single database for all services
* Single API endpoint for all services
* Single method of authorisation for all services
* Site sandboxing from the start
* Single method of deployment for all services (Docker)
* Single method of configuration for all services (config api + environment variables)
* No requirement of a commercial integration (e.g. AWS or Azure)

These helped to simplify the architecture and make it easier to maintain and develop. There are also decisions that
were made specifically for the 3 languages/areas that we use in Madoc.

* [Frontend architecture](./frontend-architecture.mdx)
* [Python architecture](./python-architecture.mdx)
* [Node architecture](./node-architecture.mdx)

Additionally, some shared services and APIs were created to support features that are common across the whole system.

- **Tasks API** - API for modelling tasks, with a queue and worker for responding to changes to those tasks.
- **Config API** - API for storing and retrieving contextual configuration values.
- **Storage API** - Single API for storing and retrieving files from the storage system - adaptable to different storage
  backends.

These services aim to solve a narrow problem and integrate with larger parts of the system. Other services can abstract
these services to provide a more specific interface for a particular use case. The Tasks API, for example, does not
know what a particular "type" of task is for, but you can tell it to dispatch events when a task is created, updated, or
it's status changes and then respond to those events. Similarly, the config API does not enforce any structure to the
config, or rules on what contexts are available - but provides you with the API to store and retrieve values in useful
ways.

This allows us to use the best tool for the job but still have shared patterns and practices across the whole system.
When starting on a new piece of functionality, these constraints help to guide the design and implementation. A typical
design process would be:

* Data model + Postgres migrations
* Database repository
* API endpoint (with permission considerations)
* Admin page in frontend for managing the data
* Frontend page for displaying the data (usually page block).
