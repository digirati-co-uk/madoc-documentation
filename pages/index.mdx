### Single end-to-end platform
Madoc uniquely covers all aspects of annotation processing end-to-end, from importing to exporting and everything else in between. This simplifies projects by minimizing the number of data handling steps and integration points.

### Comprehensive workflow support
Madoc is configurable for a wide range of potential user journeys from a simple public crowdsourcing project to more complex workflows required for scholarly studies or digital publications.

### IIIF management and enrichment
Madoc enables the sorting of images into manifests, and manifests into collections, which, when combined with its annotation and metadata management capabilities, makes it the ideal tool to manage and enrich your IIIF collections from different sources and for a variety of outputs.

### Designed to extend and integrate
If Madoc doesn't quite meet your needs then never fear! Its comprehensive apis and modular design make it easy to extend its functionality further and integrate with other tools.

### IIIF from the ground up
IIIF is baked into every aspect of the Madoc architecture, not only can you work with any material available online as IIIF, but you are also benefiting from wider community developments and tools that complement it.

### Flexible configuration
As a non-technical admin you can use the interface to set up and configure projects, including a templating mechanism to configure them to be as intuitive for users as possible depending on the nature of the project.

### A destination for showcasing
Madoc has its own flexible showcasing capabilities, so no need to take the option of outputting your project to another system for viewing your enriched collections, everything can be done in one place, including adding complimentary editorial content to your showcase.
